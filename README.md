# Acrobot_Q-LearningProject
This project implements a Q-learning agent to solve the Acrobot-v1 environment from the Gymnasium library. The Acrobot is a classic control problem involving a two-link pendulum system that must swing itself up to a target position. The solution is achieved using reinforcement learning with a discrete approximation of the continuous state space.
